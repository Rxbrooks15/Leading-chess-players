The dominant rise of Magnus Carlsen 

Intro:
Chess has become an inspiring and popular "sport" over the years, especially from the series the queens gambit
I am greatly interested in this topic as an avid chess player

To come up with a project, I first could think of using my own chess data to show my ELo increase over the years
but a more complex example could be openings I play and how likely I am to draw, lose or win with them. 
I could potentially create a animated chess board that shows the evolution of the top 3 moves over the board but that seems to complex 

From the many grandmasters, I can use some of their games to show how they have improved as players
