The dominant rise of Magnus Carlsen 
# Intro  ------------------------------------------------------------------
#Chess, an engaging mental activity, has become an inspiring "sport" over the years, especially from its appearance in the series "The Queens Gambit. I am greatly interested in this topic as an avid chess player

 To come up with a project, I first could think of using my own chess data to show my ELo increase over the years
 but a more complex example could be openings I play and how likely I am to draw, lose or win with them. 
 I could potentially create a animated chess board that shows the evolution of the top 3 moves over the board but that seems to complex 

#From the many grandmasters, I can use some of their games to show how they have improved as players
